# Training on Group-Partitioned Datasets

This directory contains examples of training on datasets generated by Dataset
Grouper. Current, there are two examples. Both of these train on a
group-partitioned version of the C4 dataset. For instructions on generating this
dataset, please see `examples/datasets`.

There are two flag-based binaries that can be run, `train_jax.py` and
`train_tff.py`. These binaries write training pipelines in JAX and TensorFlow
Federated (TFF), respectively. For information on the flags, see the binaries
themselves.
