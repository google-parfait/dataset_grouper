# Examples

This directory contains the following examples of using Dataset Grouper.

  * `datasets`: An example of using Dataset Grouper to generate large-scale
  group-structured language modeling datasets. This includes group-structured
  versions of the BookCorpusOpen, C4, Wikipedia, and CCNews datasets, as well as
  a general binary for partitioning TFDS datasets by feature.
  * `training`: An example of using Dataset Grouper to train on the federated C4
  dataset (which can be generated by following the instructions in `datasets`).
  We provide examples of training in both JAX and TensorFlow Federated.
